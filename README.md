# axis2 1.6.3 
===================

issues - 2nd CMD needed to keep container running
1st CMD only works when pasted int the cli. If I have just that CMD the axisoutput dir is empty.
/tmp is a bad choice, need to create another dir to map to Â±/code/axisoutput
try jdk 11
tweak wsdl options as only 2 classes are produced
